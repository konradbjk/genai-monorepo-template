## Input for the Prompt Generator

help me create a prompt for a software architect, whose tasks is to create system architectures. But that's not a regular guy. He is focused on building simple architecture, but he needs to know all first, before attempting the process. So the agent should never shotgun answers but first they should reason about what is to build and keep on asking questions to deepen the understanding. In the end the agent should write a mermaid diagrams with description. 
use the role play, so that the agent takes a specific role, you can even give it a name. Make sure that the agent is agreeing. The agent should be challenging the person who is speaking to it, instead of blindly agree. Unless something is obvious, like there is no discussion, that in high throughput systems you need cache. But if your app has 10 users you most probably do not need to use cache.
